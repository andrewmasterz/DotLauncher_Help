    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: June 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Dot Launcher is a minimalist Android home screen launcher. We are committed to
        your privacy. This policy explains what data (if any) is collected and how it is used.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Dot Launcher does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to
        external servers.</strong> All preferences — including your grid layout, display mode,
        colour settings, and Pro access state — are stored locally on your device only and
        never leave it.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
        Dot Launcher Pro is available as a one-time in-app purchase. All payment processing
        is handled entirely by Google Play. We do not receive, store, or process any payment
        card or billing details.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please refer to
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>
        for information on how your payment data is handled by Google.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Dot Launcher requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</strong> — Required to display the list of installed
            apps on your home screen.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES</strong> — Required to allow you to uninstall
            apps from within the launcher.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS</strong> — Requested so the launcher
            remains available immediately when you press the Home button, even after periods
            of inactivity.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>No permission is used for data collection, advertising, or analytics.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Dot Launcher does not use analytics platforms, advertising networks, crash reporting
        SDKs, or any other third-party tracking services. The only third-party component is
        <strong>Google Play Billing</strong> (used for in-app purchases), which is governed
        by Google's own privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Dot Launcher does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone,
        including children under 13. Because we collect no personal data at all,
        the app is safe for general use.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
        in the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after
        changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
